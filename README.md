Full-Stack Developer | Human-Centered Technologist | Former Nurse Turned Engineer

Hi! I'm a Full-Stack Developer originally from the U.S., now based in Barcelona, Spain. My journey into tech is a natural evolution of my skills, building on 10+ years of experience in the nursing field, where problem-solving, critical thinking, and human-centered solutions were at the core of my work.

Passionate about creating impactful digital experiences, I leverage my expertise to develop intuitive, user-friendly applications that make a difference. My technical stack includes:

🔹 Frontend: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Next, Redux, TypeScript, Vue, Pinia, Python, etc. <br/>
🔹 Backend: Express.js, Node.js, NoSQL (MongoDB), SQL (PostgreSQL), etc.

I’m always open to collaborative projects, new opportunities, and networking. Feel free to explore my work:
